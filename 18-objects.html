                An object is any piece of data that has it's own properties and methods

                properties are key/value pairs
                If I am an object "Dale", I would have the following properties (or variables)
                hair: brown;
                height: 69";
                age: old;
                music: metal;

                I could also have the following methods (or the thing that the object does)
                'drive a car';
                'take a bus';
                'teach a class';

            */

            // the var tuna is an object because it has properties
            var dale = 'I am a Dale';

            // use the [dot] separator to get the properties of an object using the `.write` method. WOW, mind blown.
            document.write(dale.length);

            // The document is an object in itself.

            // `document` is the object, `.write();` is the method on the object
