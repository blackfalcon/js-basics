            // Local and Global variable scopes

            /*
                Understanding which variables are accessible in any given
                part of your JS code is critical to avoiding bugs and writing
                clear code. Here's the basics...

                Functions act as a way of creating a new scope:

                Global variable - a var that is accessible OUTSIDE all functions
                Local variable - a var accessible only INSIDE a function

                A local variable will not be accessible in any scope outside
                of the scope in which it was defined.
            */

            // This is a global var, accessilbe in every scope:
            var wife = 'Jennifer';

            function outPut() {
                // This is a local var, accessible only in this function's scope:
                var daughter = 'Zoe';

                /*
                    WATCH OUT: With no "var" keyword, variables are created in the global scope. Always use var.
                */
                son = 'Micah' // ANTIPATTERN

                document.write(wife);
                document.write(daughter);
                document.write(son);
            }

            // Notice in the view how the var of `daughter` does not appear
            // This is because `daughter` is scoped to the outPut function
            outPut();
            document.write(wife);
            document.write(son);
            document.write(daughter); // This causes an error, script halted.
        </script>
