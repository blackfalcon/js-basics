#Intro to JS, the Basics

This repo is a simple step-by-step introduction to basic concepts in JavaScript. It was these simple exercises that helped me to greater understand how JavaScript works, so I hope that this helps you too as well. 

The repo has a very simple directory with the step-by-step examples named appropriately. Comments within the code are there to explain the feature being addressed within the example. 

Excuse the mess, but this is a new project that I hope to continue adding new examples to. 

Each file is a self contained `html` doc, so you should be able to copy/pull the code and open in any browser and it should work. If you discover any bugs and/or think that I am explaining things incorrectly, please provide feedback and/or submit a pull request. 

Thanks!
