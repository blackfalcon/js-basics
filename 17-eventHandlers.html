            Event Handlers - let's make this interactive
            What's interesting is that this can be placed within the standard HTML

            Within HTML attributes is where you inject the JavaScript

            These are browser native controls - no need for additional programming

            These events do not run automatically

        <button onClick="alert('Wow, you clicked me'); alert('This is another box');">This is a button</button>

        <!--
            Notice the `;` syntax. This allows you to concatenate instructions. While you can do this, it is probably better to make this into a function.

        <p onMouseOut="alert('you left my space!')"> This is a vacuum of space</p>
